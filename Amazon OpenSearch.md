- Successor to Amazon ElasticSearch
- DynamoDB - Query on Primary Key 
- OpenSearch -==Search any field, even partial matches== 
- common: use OpenSearch as complement to another DB
- ==2 Modes:==
	- Managed cluster 
	- Serverless cluster 
- SQL Support not available  natively 
	- Can be enabled with ==plugin== 
- Ingestion 
	- KDF 
	- AWS IOT 
	- CloudWatch Logs 
- Security 
	- Cognito 
	- IAM 
	- KMS Encryption 
	- TLS
- Comes with ==OpenSearch Dashboards== 

## Patterns 
- With DynamoDB 
	- CRUD to DynamoDB -> DynamoDB streams -> Lambda function -> OpenSearch 
	- Now app can search through opensearch and use DynamoDB to get the items .
- With [[CloudWatch Logs]]
	- Send logs using subscription filter to Lambda which can send to ==OpenSearch in Real Time.==
	- Send to KDF instead of lambda that will s==end in near real time to OpenSearch==
- Sending Kinesis Data streams
	- to KDF and then to Open Search== in near real-time== 
	- to Lambda (real-time) -> OpenSearch
