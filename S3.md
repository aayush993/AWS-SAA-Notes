## Notes
1.  S3 read-after-write consistency.
	1. S3 is strongly consistent for all it's operations.
2. Copy data across region in S3 buckets 
	1. setup replication 
	2. use sync command ( for copying less than 10 million objects) for more use Batch repication.
	3. cannot use transfer acceleration to sync buckets.
