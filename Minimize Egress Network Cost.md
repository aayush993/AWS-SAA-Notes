- Egress traffic - outbound 
- Ingress traffic - inbound usually free. 
- Try to keep as much traffic in AWS as possible. 
	- Like - if you are querying DB from AWS and getting data to on-prem 
		- Then querying the same. 
	- Instead you can move your app to AWS (Same AZ as DB). query data in AWS itself. 
		- Send only the result out. Cost is minimized
- For direct connect, Use location that are collocated in same AWS region 
	- to minimize egress cost.
